# Complete Row-Level Security

## Trigger

When a multi-tenant application stores user, workspace, account, or organization data in a shared database, especially when tables or object storage are added.

## Invariant

Every read, insert, update, and delete is constrained to the authenticated owner or tenant. Database policies and storage policies express the same boundary independently of application filtering.

## Failure pattern

A new table, relation, RPC, or storage bucket is reachable without the same tenant restriction as existing data. The application appears account-safe in normal flows but a direct query, alternate endpoint, or missing filter crosses the boundary.

## Recommended method

Treat tenant isolation as a database invariant. Enable RLS on every exposed table, add explicit policies for each operation, constrain inserts as well as reads, and mirror the rule in storage policies. Add schema-level tests that enumerate tables and policies instead of checking only hand-picked examples.

## Discriminating checks

- Enumerate exposed tables and assert each has RLS enabled and policies for its supported operations.
- Attempt cross-tenant select, insert, update, and delete with authenticated test identities.
- Test storage object access with an object belonging to another tenant.
- Inspect new migrations for tables or buckets added without a policy.

## Common traps

- Relying on a server-side `owner_id` filter as the only protection.
- Protecting reads but forgetting inserts or updates.
- Assuming a relation inherits the parent table's policy.
- Treating service-role access as representative of user access.
